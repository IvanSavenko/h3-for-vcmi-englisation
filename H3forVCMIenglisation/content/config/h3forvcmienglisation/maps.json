The two lords of Shireton, the Guardians as they are called, are rumored to have sided with the denizens of The Underworld against the King.  You must go and confirm this vile rumor.

After a quick visit to the outhouse, where you toss the rest of your breakfast, you calmly tell Cough-mumble-mumble to give you all the details of Something-or-other's death.

Your met your \"secret\" visitor in his quarters.  It turned out to be Dorie, chambermaid agent at large.  She said she was certain the food taster was up to \"No Good,\" but she hadn't been able to catch him at \"Anything.\"  She thought he might be passing notes in the tavern, but she couldn't get close enough to tell without being noticed.  She needed to recruit a couple of stable lads to keep a closer watch on Cough-mumble-mumble (and wasn't that a clever nickname), if you didn't mind.  You were amazed.  You hadn't realized it was possible to talk that fast while whispering.  Suppressing you laughter, you gave her the permission she wanted and went back to bed.",

They seem surprised when you decided to spend a few days with them.  Morale seemed to improve, once they found you were staying in the barracks with the guards.  The second night there was a bandit raid.  It was a dark, confusing, fight but the bandits were driven off.  The guards seem greatly cheered by your presence, not that you did anything more than swing at half-seen shapes not in guard uniforms.  You don't think you hit any bandits but you certainly killed a bush or two.",

Your chair in the Great Hall exploded the morning after you left on your surprise inspection.

You send word to you spies set up a retaliatory assassination attempt on your enemy, preferably one that goes \"BANG\".",

Then you really woke up, turned and hid behind your chest of drawers.  The door to the room shuddered a few times, then burst open.  Masked men came charging into your room and proceeded to hack the bed, sheets, pillows, blankets, spread and bed curtains to pieces.  While they were killing the bed, you tiptoed out of the room, past the wounded guard by the door, and ran for the nearest guardroom.  From there you had the guard turn out and attack the assassins.  At the end of the night the score was one bed for them, seven assassins for you.",

As soon as you arrived, Dorie began to speed whisper her report.  Cough-mumble-mumble, the food taster and lawyer, \"Was\" the enemy spymaster.  He was the \"One\" responsible for all the \"Assassinations\".  He was running his \"Operation\" from his secret headquarters located in the castle \"Outhouse\".  You had to sit down after hearing this news.  What idiot would run a spy operation from an outhouse?  After pondering this question for a moment, you ordered the Captain to get some guards and come with you to arrest Cough-mumble-mumble.  ",

One look at your group was enough.  He took off running for his headquarters with everyone in hot pursuit.  He made it to the outhouse before anyone else and slammed and locked the old rickety door.  The four guards with you tried to break the door down, but instead knocked the whole outhouse over. His sanctuary gone, Cough-mumble-mumble sprang at you and tried to strangle you.  The Captain knocked him off of you then Dorie tripped him and old Cough-mumble-mumble fell down the shaft of the pit toilet and drowned before anyone could fish him out.  Thus ended the saga of Cough-mumble-mumble.  What was his name anyway?",
